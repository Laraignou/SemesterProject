# SemesterProject
Movie recommendation system


Project name
    Movie recommendation system
Short description
    The application is made as an exam project and has a list of requirements:
                Getting data: Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and data stores.
                Preparing data: Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transforming data for analysis.
                Transformation: Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets (e.g., aggregating a large table by group variables in numpy and/or pandas)
                Modeling and computation: Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools
                Presentation: Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations and/or textual summaries
