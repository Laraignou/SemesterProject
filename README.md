# SemesterProject

# Project name
    Movie recommendation system
# Short description
    The application is made as an exam project and has a list of requirements:
                Getting data: Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and data stores.
                Preparing data: Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transforming data for analysis.
                Transformation: Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets (e.g., aggregating a large table by group variables in numpy and/or pandas)
                Modeling and computation: Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools
                Presentation: Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations and/or textual summaries

# List of used technologies
    Python Libraies:
        matplotlib
        numpy
        tf-nightly
        seaborn
        pandas
        tqdm
        console-menu

# Prerequisites:
* Python 3.1.x
* Command Prompt (CMD)

# Installation guide (if any libraries need to be installed):
    From CMD run "python main.py" (from SemesterProject/Project/main.py)

# User guide (how to run the program)
    As above

# Status (What has been done (and if anything: what was not done))
    * Most requirements were met but a lot of functions were not implemented.
    * Database interaction was intended but not finished (e.g. machine learning.)
    * Automation was prioritized.
    * We implemented a download manager for downloading our zipped dataset to minimize file size.

# List of Challenges you have set up for your self (The things in your project you want to highlight)
    * GUI - How to visualize
    * Working with large datasets
    * Machine learning
    * Automation
